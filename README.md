# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

The Student Performance Analysis project is designed to predict the performance score of students based on various input parameters. This project leverages machine learning models to analyze the data provided by the users and generate accurate predictions. The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Frontend**
2. **Backend**
3. **Data Analytics**

## Key Features

- **User Input:** Collects data from the user through a user-friendly interface.
- **Prediction Score:** Uses machine learning models to predict the performance score of the user.
- **Interactive Interface:** Provides a seamless and interactive user experience through various pages like landing page, login, signup, generation form, and success page.

## Project Structure

### Frontend

The frontend component is responsible for creating an engaging and intuitive user interface. The primary pages included in the frontend are:

- **Landing Page:** The homepage of the application where users get an overview of the project.
- **Login Page:** Allows existing users to log in to their accounts.
- **Signup Page:** Enables new users to create an account.
- **Generation Form:** The form where users input their data for performance prediction.
- **Success Page:** Displays the predicted performance score and relevant insights.

### Backend

The backend component handles the server-side operations, including:

- User authentication and authorization.
- Handling user input and storing it in the database.
- Communicating with the machine learning model to get predictions.
- Sending the prediction results back to the frontend.

### Data Analytics

The data analytics team is responsible for:

- Collecting and preprocessing the data.
- Training and optimizing the machine learning models.
- Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the prediction scores.
- Analyzing user data to improve the model over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm for the frontend
- Python and required libraries for the backend and machine learning model
- Database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for data storage
